Main repo to store all data and analysis in regards to the National Mental Health Datahton.

Potential hypothesis to analyze:
- Human interaction and face-to-face conversations, although can be difficult, are one of the main key ways to have better mental health
    - Do people that don't participate in groups and organizations have worse or better mental health? What can be used to measure this?
- Self-regulation techniques and teaching people how to deal with and overcome acute mental challenges is vital in maintaining/improving ones mental health
- Lack of compassionate relationships and the negative impact on mental health
    - Using the consensus data, look into whether single people are worse off

Use geographical data to add context and measure relative distance to community type buildings, areas, clubs, etc. (if possible)

Important points:
- Participating in community groups is associated with a strong sense of belonging, which is in turn associated with better mental health
- Canadians facing mental health or substance use challenges are more likely not to have a family doctor, which can hinder their access to mental health care
- Canadians with high personal screen time have lower mental health indicators
- Although 13% showed signs of harmful or dependent alcohol use and 10% showed similar signs with cannabis use, only 2% of Canadians accessed substance use health support last year (indicates the need for one to self-regulate)
- Two in three Canadians feel at least somewhat confident in their ability to bounce back from challenges (how do we increase this?)
- Three in five Canadians who accessed substance use health support were satisfied about it (this seems low)
- There is a correlation between a sense of belonging and fewer mental health challenges
- Lack of motivation and time are the main reasons cited for not participating in group activities (interesting, how are people motivated?)
- One in three Canadians are exposed to content that may incite hate or violence monthly, while more than one in ten are exposed daily

[THE STATE OF MENTAL HEALTH IN CANADA 2024](https://cmha.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CMHA-State-of-Mental-Health-2024-report.pdf)

Important points:
- Backs up assertion that not enough money is spent on mental health, meaning there are not enough mental health resources available
- It emphasizes the need for more data (need to investigate further, what data isn't available? Is it already obvious that the people in the north have a lower state of mental health? Prove this assertion?)
- 9.1% - Percentage of those with poor-to-fair mental health who experienced discrimination and victimization
- 54.4% - Percentage of population with poor-to-fair mental health who report feeling a stronger sense of belonging to community
- Reported rate of drug-related offences: 162 (emphazises the drug problem)
